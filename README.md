# hello
A repository created when I'm learning how to use this.

-  It's a very nice day in Nanjing,China. And I'm very glad this can be published as a symbel to
show my work.
-  Frankly, I don't know if this time i spent would benifits my future work as a acoustic student.Who knows.
At least, it is not bad. That's enough.ok That's all, let's continue to learn.
